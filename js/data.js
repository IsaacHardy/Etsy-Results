"title": "D10P Dice Pendant - Dungeons and Dragons -  Velvet Purple - Geek Gamer DnD Role Playing RPG - Paw & Claw Designs",
"description": "Show them how you roll with this 10-sided percentile die pendant.\r\n\r\nVelvet Purple with gold numbers. \r\n\r\nTHIS DIE IS DISCONTINUED! Get it while you can!\r\n\r\nGreat for Geeks.\r\n\r\nGreat for Posers.\r\n\r\nJust freakin&#39; great.\r\n\r\nThe wires in the dice are set with super strong 2,500 PSI epoxy! I put a bit on the top of the dice as well as inside the hole, and wrap the loop up tight. This helps to keep the dice secure on the wire and makes them super durable.\r\n\r\nRed Brass wire, gold plated ball chain and clasp, which measures 20 inches.\r\n\r\nAny Die, Die, My Darling Necklace can be changed to a satin cord or key chain, for those who do not wear jewelry, at no additional charge. Just send me a message through &quot;contact pawandclawdesigns&quot; to arrange the change.\r\n\r\nWith every &quot;Die, Die My Darling&quot; purchase of $30 or more, you will get a FREE Copy of the &quot;King of RPGs&quot; Mini-comic. This wonderful comic, written by Jason Thompson and drawn by Victor Hao, features a necklace similar to the D20 Pendants. Looks for the full length Volume 1 in January 2010.\r\n\r\n http://kingofrpgs.com\r\n\r\n********************************************************************************\r\n\r\nPlease take few minutes to read my &quot;Shop Policies&quot; Page, located at the link to the right of my shops homepage, http://pawandclawdesigns.etsy.com or at the bottom of the item page.\r\n\r\nMy polices page should tell you everything you need to know about making your purchase from Paw & Claw Designs on Etsy.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to click on “contact” to send me a message if you require more information.

"description": "~Reduced n&#39; Ready~\r\nAll Ready-to-Ship items are 20% off! Use &quot;RnR20&quot; at checkout to redeem!\r\n\r\nFREE SHIPPING Anywhere - Select items (such as this one) are now available for FREE shipping to anywhere the USPS will deliver in the US or internationally!\r\n\r\nSeven pieces all cut, pierced and sewn by hand, this bag is created using a my own pattern I designed for it. Each one of these has approximately 3-4 hours of work into them (4-5 with accenting), with each stitch crafted by meticulous healer&#39;s hands. I am quite proud of this little beauty, and it still remains one of my most popular items at events, and through orders all over the world.\r\n\r\n~~~LIMITED QUANTITY~~~\r\nDue to supply stock and other matters, this item is at risk of running out quickly.\r\nWhat this means for you - if you like this item, don&#39;t delay ordering it, as all orders of this stock are first-come, first-serve, and when it&#39;s gone, it may never return!\r\n\r\nPerfect for carrying your collection of crystals, gaming dice, change, etc!\r\n\r\nCurrent reviews for this item:\r\n~Anymous~\r\n&quot;The Drawstring Bag we ordered arrived today. Very fast shipping! The color of the bag is a beautiful green and the artistry of the bag is fantastic. The hand stitches are perfect. Thank You!!!!!&quot;\r\n\r\nThis customer further described their satisfaction with \r\n&quot;It is the perfect color and made so very well. The bag did meet and exceed our expectations.&quot;\r\n\r\nThese bags have been a hit at past events, and currently remain one of my most highly appraised designs. Taking a shape similar to an orb when closed, they are both beautiful and functional with their long drawstring cords that can easily tie in a bow or be used as small purse/hand bag. As far as durability… well, this general model of bag has been field tested swinging on the arm of a rather energetic 4 year old child and survived perfectly! A customer reported that after 2 years of use for carrying dice (the ones pictured, in fact) the bag is still holding up perfectly (despite some rough treatment and tossing on their part.)\r\n\r\nAs for usefulness? You can fit a variety of little nicknacks in this design, including but not limited to: rune stones,gaming dice (dungeons and dragons, warhammer, etc), tokens, crystals, folded bills, herbs, up to a couple 1 oz bottle of oil (or a couple 1/2 or several 1/3 oz or 1-2 dram bottles), thread, bobbins (and other sewing goodies)\r\n\r\nPlease read our policies for any questions you might have, including shipping, Made-To-Order, etc.\r\n\r\n~PLEASE TAKE NOTE~\r\nWhen shipped, this item will be inside out (this makes it ship easier/quicker), and will need to be turned right side out before initial use.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Free Shipping&quot; is for domestic orders only; however, the international rates are reduced.\r\n\r\nThese pictures are intended as representative images only. Individual pouches may vary slightly in appearance. Please keep in mind that leather is a natural product and no two hides are alike. Likewise, any markings or color variations are unique characteristics and are not to be considered defects.",

"title": "Chainmaille Triforce Dice Bag With Flames",
"description": "I had a customer request a dice bag with black, white and orange, and she wanted a Triforce.  I&#39;ve had this flame dice bag brewing in my head for a while now, so I had the idea to combine the two.  It&#39;s maximum geekery in one place - chainmaille, Legend of Zelda, and fiyaaaaaahhhhh!   You know you want to set everything on fire, Trogdor the level 1 wizard.  You&#39;re the Burninator and you deserve a dice bag that reflects your heart&#39;s desire.\n\nWell, this will certainly maximize your fireball.  While it&#39;s not a dice bag of holding, the medium size should keep up to 40 standard dice and the large version 70+ dice without a problem, and unless you have some insanely tiny dice, they won&#39;t slip through the holes.  If you need a larger version of this, send a message.\n\nThere is also a version of this without the Triforce, just flames.  If you don&#39;t see the listing let me know.\n\nChainmaille items are guaranteed; if the finish wears off the rings or one happens to break, I do repairs for the cost of shipping the item.\n\nA note, because of the spontaneous nature of me weaving fire, your bag may not look exactly like this (at least the fire part).  If you have an idea for a custom bag and you don&#39;t see the listing, drop me a note, I enjoy working with customers to make the perfect thing.",

It&#39;s slinky, tactile, touchable.  I love making things in bright colors, rainbow colors, and also sterling silver and stainless steel.  But my favorite is hypoallergenic niobium.\r\n\r\nI also make wire wrapped jewelry, weaving wire and with a lot of trademark loops and swirls.  I enjoy using semiprecious stones and crystals, and love learning about the metaphysical properties of each stone -- not just a kind of stone (like quartz), but getting to know each individual one.\r\n\r\nI enjoy doing custom work so I am always interested to hear if you have a stone, coin, or other item that is important to you that you would like me to wire wrap in my signature style.  I also do chainmail in various colors and materials upon request, so please drop me a line if I can be of help.\r\n\r\nThank you for stopping by!\r\n\r\nYou can find my website at http://wwww.youvegotmaille.net\r\nand Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/youvegotmaille\r\n\r\nIf you happen to find yourself in little Sparta, Tennessee, you can see my work for sale at Fragrant Mushroom Gallery, 12 W Bockman Way (across from the courthouse).

"title": "OwlBear Cub Art Doll - Handmade OOAK Plush",
"description": "Aw, look at this little fella! This sweet owlbear is only a baby. He needs someone to take care of him until he can grow up to be a terrifying abomination. \n\nJasper the Owlbear is a one of a kind art doll, completely handmade and sewn from a pattern of my own design. His face is sculpted from Cernit polymer clay and embedded with real feathers. He has hand-painted glass eyes and his body is sewn from thick, multicolored faux fur. He is stuffed with fiberfill and plastic pellets. He has talon-like claws in his feet and hands, also made from polymer clay. Jasper measures 16&quot; long and is sewn into a sitting position. He is not poseable. \n\nJasper is a realistic, one of a kind (OOAK) art doll. He was created by artist Alia Bierwag (that&#39;s me!) for Outpost 8. He is very cuddly but has semi-fragile parts and is meant for display and not a toy for children.\n\nThe price of shipping includes USPS Priority Mail, insurance, and delivery and signature confirmation. Your new owl bear plush is Ready to Ship (RTS) and will be packaged carefully and shipped within 2 days of your order. He should arrive in 2-3 days. (International orders take 1-4 weeks.)\n\nHandmade, one of a kind art plushies such as Jasper make great, unique gifts! He would be perfect for any doll or animal lover or D&D fan. It&#39;s easy to picture him keeping you company during your next gaming session, peering down at you from a ledge, or wherever you please. I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have the perfect spot for him!\n\n* If you would like to set up a payment plan for Jasper, please send me a message and I will be happy to oblige. \n\nA portion of the revenue I make from each of my dolls goes to support the Friends of the Earth charity: http://www.foe.org/",

"description": "You are commissioning me to construct a wonderful gnome door / faerie door for the Wee Folk in your garden or home.\n\nThis charming fairy door door is approximately 5.5 inches high by 3.5 inches wide. It is constructed by me with care from 3/4 inch solid pine or select ply board. This door can also accommodate pixies, elves, hobbits, and even the tooth fairy. :)\n\nPlease note: Because this item is hand made, the one you receive MAY vary slightly from the one in the picture...but will essentially look the same. :)\n\nThese doors also look great against the skirting of a house, or even on a shelf. You can easily attach the door to any surface using the keyhole slot on the door&#39;s back panel.\n\nThis door does not open except for the &#39;Wee Folk&#39; that dwell within. :)\n\nI will happily combine shipping on multiple orders and any excess shipping you pay is reimbursed when your package is mailed. If you wish to order multiple items and would like me to create a listing that includes your items with a combined shipping charge, just convo me and I will be happy to do so.\n\nPlease allow me up to 2 weeks to have construction finished and the item packaged and ready to mail! This is a good faith estimate of time needed to make your item. Depending on how busy I am, it might be quicker, or it could be a bit longer. Convo me if you&#39;re concerned about meeting a specific deadline. \n\nThank you. :)",

I am the person behind the saw who cuts, sands, paints, stains, decorates, packs and sends all the creations you see in my store.  :)\r\n\r\nAbout my work:\r\nWood - As my ID &quot;nothinbutwood&quot; suggests, all the items in my store are made exclusively from wood, or at least are comprised mostly of wood. \r\n\r\nMost of the items in my store fall into the category of out-of-doors &#39;Wee Folk&#39; (i.e. gnomes, fairies, etc) garden accessories.\r\n\r\nI enjoy creating the items for this little niche VERY much.  I always use solid pine board or high quality plywood for all my creations.  All of the items fare just fine being outside.  I would recommend applying a clear weather seal at least once a year to extend the life of the wood.\r\n\r\nAll of my items are listed with a quantity of 1.  \r\n\r\n*** IF YOU WISH TO ORDER MULTIPLES OF AN ITEM, JUST CONVO ME AND I&#39;LL DO A CUSTOM LISTING FOR YOU, THAT WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE COMBINED SHIPPING.***\r\n\r\nPlease heed the processing times listed in my items.  This time is an average estimate of how long it will take me to process your order based on the number of orders I have ahead of yours.\r\n\r\nI always try to get the orders out as quick as I can.  However, I am just one person, and I have a family and a day job in addition to my hobby.  I won&#39;t sacrifice quality for quantity so there may be times you will have to wait a little longer than normal.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about a timeline, don&#39;t hesitate to drop me a line.  :)",
"policy_payment": "Direct payment and Paypal are the preferred methods of payment.\r\n\r\nIf paying by cheque, please make the cheque payable to me, Kerry Roberts...not my Etsy id.  My bank will not cash cheques made out to &#39;NothinButWood&#39; :)\r\n\r\n***PLEASE PLEASE ensure the address you enter on your order is correct.  Time does not permit me the luxury of manually verifying or changing addresses.  If your address is correct, notify me and I will cancel your order and you can resubmit with the correct address.",
"policy_shipping": "I ship via Canada Post and all packages are insured up to $100.  Additional coverage is available at $1 for every $100.\r\n\r\nTracking is NOT available on &quot;small packets US&quot; or &quot;small packets international&quot;.  If you wish to have tracking,  advise me BEFORE purchasing and I will let you know a shipping rate for a &quot;tracked&quot; package to your location.\r\n\r\nShipping from Canada to the US can take 2-3 weeks on average (and sometimes up to 6 weeks).\r\n\r\nShipping from Canada to overseas destinations can take 3-4 weeks on average (and sometimes up to 8 weeks).",
"policy_refunds": "Your complete satisfaction is very important to me.  I work very hard to ensure each piece I craft meets, and hopefully exceeds, your expectations.  Because all my pieces are handmade, there may be slight variations in the piece you receive.  For example, the wood stain may look slightly different, or the accessories used to decorate the piece may vary slightly.\r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied, for any reason, with your purchase, don&#39;t hesitate to contact me.",

"description": "This adorably creepy creature is hungry... for dice, coins, damage counters or small miniatures! This makes it the perfect companion for gaming events, cosplay, conventions or everyday use.\n\nIts body is made out of brown faux fur, with a combination of fleece and felt details. The outer fangs are stuffed with polyfill to keep their shape, and the inside teeth are made of felt, so you don&#39;t have to worry about carrying a venom antidote around while you&#39;re gaming.\n\nThe six eyeballs are attached by careful machine applique, and it has a drawstring closure. The dice in the photos are shown for size reference.\n\nEach one is carefully crafted using a combination of machine and hand stitching for the finer details. It is handmade to order and will differ slightly from one another.\n\nAs with all my items, this spider-like monster dice bag is one of a kind and created using 100% cruelty-free vegan materials.\n\nTo see other cute creature accessories I have available, visit my shop:\n\nCraftedCreatureShop.etsy.com\n\nIf you have a different creature or character you would like to be made in to a dice bag, message me for a custom order!",

"title": "Stainless Steel Metal D20 Gaming Dice by Butler&#39;s Specialty Dice",
"description": "Ross&#39;s original 20-sided steel dice are quickly becoming a favorite among serious gamers looking for that perfect, unique piece for their collection.\n\nThese are a full size gaming die instead of miniature like other metal dice. The unique hollow design makes the weight feel just right and keeps them playable rather than being overly heavy eye candy. Once you&#39;ve played with these steel dice, it&#39;s difficult to go back to plastic.\n\nTo reduce noise and protect table finishes, we highly recommend rolling these dice on a felt lined dice tray or similar surface. Even a simple sheet of thin craft foam makes a great rolling surface.\n\nEach die is made using modern 3D production technology and then meticulously hand cleaned and painted.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nDesigner: Ross Butler\n\nMaterial: Bronze-infused Stainless Steel with painted recesses\n\nApproximate Sizes & Weight:\n-19mm side to side & 23mm point to point\n-12 grams (For comparison, plastic dice average about 5g )",

"title": "Gamer Dice Liquor Hip Flask",
"description": "Makes an awesome gift or a treasured keeper.\r\n\r\nThis is a brand new stainless steel liquor hip flask. It holds 6 ounces of fluid. It comes boxed. The size is \r\napproximately  3 3/4&quot; wide by 4 1/2&quot; high to the cap by 1&quot; thick with a curve.\r\nFits perfect in your pocket. All of my flasks are HAND inspected for leaks, rust, residue, dents and other imperfections. I reject 1/2 of all flasks before making them and sell them in bulk to my competitors. The process I use isn’t found anywhere else. I spent years perfecting the process.  Don’t be fooled by products made in factories. All of my items are handmade custom pieces. I also have the funnels available for purchase at no additional shipping charge if purchased with a flask.\r\n\r\n The image is covered in a heavy waterproof epoxy resin as seen by the shadowing \r\nIn photo pictures. This is NOT a cheap stick on photo, this is superior\r\n HIGH QUALITY artwork. I use a special process that I hand make to cover the image and protect it.  \r\nThe image is a vivid color high quality graphic production. I guarantee my product.\r\n 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed!\r\n If you have any questions at all please contact me. Because I make all of the flasks individually by hand it can take a few days to have them made and ready for shipment.  If you need it by a certain date please let me know and I will accommodate it if I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****If you want more than one or would like several different designs please contact me and I will work out a special price for you. \r\n\r\n*****If you have a special design you want done please contact me and I will have it done for you.

"description": "*** YOU WILL NOT GET THE DRAGONS PICTURED ABOVE! They are an example pair of the cake topper. This listing is for a CUSTOM, one-of-a-kind dice dragon couple cake topper of your chosen colors. ***\n\nPlease choose from the drop down menu what details (or no details) you would like on your topper.  Certain details are not included in the base price. If you want a regular set, you need to purchase the &quot;Undetailed&quot; from the drop down menu. \n\nAlso note: the &quot;Everything&quot; option in the drop down menu includes 1 Veil, 1 Bouquet, 1 Top Hat, and 1 Bow tie \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAwwww!\n\nThese pair of dice dragons are holding D20s while going nose-to-nose and forming a heart with their tails.\n\nWhen purchasing this listing, you are buying a custom order and need to give me these details:\n\nDo you want the dragons to have corresponding colors, like the ones pictured? If not specified the dragons will have matching colors to their die as well as their mate.\n\nDragon #1:\nBody colors (I recommend at least three for the swirled effect)\nEye color\n\n\nDragon #2:\nBody colors (I recommend at least three for the swirled effect)\nEye color\n\n\nI will match the dragons with a similar die. If you have a particular die in mind, please also specify but be aware that I may not be able to get it, so secondary options are helpful. I will do my very best and typically have a bunch of colorful d20s in stock. Also if you would rather, I can also get a different type of die- d4, d8, d10, d12, etc..\n\nEach dragon couple will be one-of-a-kind and look different, even from the ones pictured. I will do my best to keep the same shape but each come out unique.\n\nThis is a custom-made set just for you. Please order early, and plan for 2-3 weeks construction (I work 2 jobs in addition to this) and 2-5 days shipping in the US, 2-3 weeks shipping Canada. If you need your order sooner, please add on our &quot;Rush Order&quot; listing. This being said, I will do my best to have it out to you as quickly as possible.",
